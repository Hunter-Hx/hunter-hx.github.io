    <summary><strong>After Everything</strong></summary>
    <p>
      At night, when the tie is hung,<br>
      And the T-shirts lie scattered,<br>
      Socks on the floor,<br>
      The kitchen still warm with dinner.<br>

       When the wigs are removed,<br> 
       And the makeup is washed,<br>
      The shelf in disarray,<br>
      And the vest is on,<br>
      The TV is muted and the assignment is are done,<br>
      The kids half-asleep and the doors locked,<br>
      That's when 'love' happens-<br>
       Or whatever they call it.<br>

    <summary><strong>Frozen Embrace</strong></summary>
    <p>
Wake up boy!<br>
Dig that grave<br>
And release your friends to the waiting angels,,<br>
Is not bad to be lonely, you see?,<br>
The world will not pamper you boy!<br>

Boy!  Take that shovel<br>
Mix that sand and gravel<br> 
And get messy in it,<br>
Question your flaws, critique with honesty<br> 
And if need be, surrender,<br>
The world is not your mom, boy!<br>

Boy! This is your toll,<br>
Sweat all day long,<br>
Endure hunger if provisions fail,<br>
Boy! Future is for you,<br>
You gotta be tough boy!<br>

Boy! Walk the streets,<br>
Cry and get eliminated,<br>
The World has no use for cry babies,<br>
Boy! Your tears better be viscous!<br>

    <summary><strong>Unfinished Prayer</strong></summary>
    <p>
      I prayed with broken sentences,<br>
      faith stitched with doubt.<br>
      Heaven listened--

   <summary><strong>In A Dream Today</strong></summary>
  <p>
    
In a dream today,<br>
You wore no veil.<br>
I could see your ears<br>
And it was not pierced.<br>
In a dream today,<br>
You wore no glasses<br>
I could see your naked eye<br> 
I could tell their color.<br>
And it was the first time I got to believe<br> 
That man is not a machine<br>
But can be ignited by the sparkles in your eyes.<br>
In a dream today,<br>
You wore no shoes.<br>
I could see your small feet<br>
They're that of the Egyptian goddess.<br>
In a dream today.<br>
You wore no gloves.<br>
I could see your slimy fingers.<br>
And I could tell they fell cold.<br>
It was the first time I got to believe.<br>
That man is not an energy bulb.<br>
But can be turned on by the flicky touch of your cold hands<br>

    <summary><strong>A Song For Two</strong></summary>
    <p>
     My fingers bleed out anytime I try to play guitar.<br>
Its strings are too thin to strum.<br>
So the melody in my head never gets out.<br>
Here I am with a bow tuning love from the heart with my new violin.<br>
This is why I would not leave the Lute family.<br>
They made me miss the person I used to be.<br>
So tonight<br>
I deserve the rhythm of my music in pure silence.<br><br>
Tonight my bandaged fingers will strum<br>
The agony that travels from the tongue of the wrong mind<br>
Crush your heart, and journey through your veins and hold it venom.<br>
If it leaves your thoughts paralyzed<br>
Then I'll be your healer.<br>
To unveil your true desire.<br>
Thus, "Solitude is not the doom you yearn for."<br><br>
Her warm touch hurts like the truth.<br>
Her smile is as beautiful as the sunset.<br>
It's scary when she's silent.<br>
Like a nightmare, her absence keeps me awake.<br>
So I'll send you a bird to sing a song for two.<br>
And when you're back, I'll play for you to stay.<br>

    <summary><strong>Ashes</strong></summary>
    <p>
      I’ve seen his dark side before.<br>
When his demons rise,<br>
He knocks of every gold in his path like garbage.<br>
He hunts the nights but I choose to wait<br>
At the end of every dawn<br>
Just to see this phoenix rise from his ashes.<br>
