    <p>
     On that Saturday afternoon,<br>
As light showers gently fall,<br>
My eulogy read, perhaps some poems too,<br>
Praises of how kind or cruel I was,<br>
But it won't matter much,<br>
For I'll be on my own,<br>
Quiet and dressed in my finest attire,<br>
A walk in the park, but a knife in my heart,<br>
Gasping for air,<br>
I'll journey to my eternal abode,<br>
As you watch the earth cover me up:<br>
...and the final words will be said...<br>
I won’t hear them, I'll be gone.<br>
That'll be it,<br>
Vanished, with no trace,<br>
But please don't shed tears.<br>
Will you remember me when I'm gone?
    </p>
