    <p>
      Who have I wronged?<br>
To suffer until the end,<br>
With every hope bent<br>
And no friend.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
Who have I wronged?<br>
To soak my pillow with tears,<br>
Endless sadness and fears,<br>
Borrowing only to hear<br>
It's all in arrears.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
Who have I wronged?<br>
That I stress my brain,<br>
Sleep in the rain,<br>
In vain,<br>
But hope to one day reign.<br><br>
      
      <p>
Who have I wronged?<br>
That everyone pretends,<br>
I am no use to them,<br>
Expelled like trash to fend<br>
For myself, a broken blend.<br>
      Who have I wronged?<br>
Who have I really wronged?
    </p>
