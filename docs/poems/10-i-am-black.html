    <p>
I am black,<br>
My tears flow blackened,<br>
And my vision dark,<br>
Everything in me, obscured,<br>
So, they say –<br>
I’m filled with sadness.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
I am black,<br>
A primitive creature to some,<br>
But with an undeniable history,<br>
And yes, I’m black,<br>
My culture, unique,<br>
And my thirst for knowledge, insatiable,<br>
      I am black.<br><br>
    </p>


    <p>
      I am black,<br>
With a heart as dark as coal, they claim,<br>
But red blood runs through my veins,<br>
And they judge me from my skin,<br>
Yes, I’m a child of the blacks,<br>
I am black.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
I am black,<br>
My mind misunderstood,<br>
But soon I’ll make them understand,<br>
Yes, I am black.<br>
I am black,<br>
And I won’t apologize for it,<br>
Though sometimes I wish I were green,<br>
      How would they treat me then?<br>
Like grass?
