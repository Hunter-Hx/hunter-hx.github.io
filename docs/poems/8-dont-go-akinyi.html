    <p>
      Hold my hand, Akinyi,<br>
Don't let our young love story end<br>
I told you about her<br>
I told you she requested it,<br>
Don't let a hug ruin it, Akinyi,<br><br>
      
Don't go, Akinyi,<br>
One moment with her<br>
And my mind is on you,<br>
You know our love story,<br>
Short and sweet<br>
Why can't you hold me, Akinyi<br><br>
      
Don't cry, Akinyi<br>
It's you<br>
And you know it,<br>
I've never lied to you<br>
So why are you leaving?<br><br>
      
      Roses aren't always red,<br>
Violets aren't always blue,<br>
Don't leave and leave me feeling blue,<br>
I didn't know it would hurt you,<br>
Come and lie<br>
On my chest,<br>
As a bubble I blew.<br><br>
      
Don't go, Akinyi,<br>
It'll be a shame<br>
If our love story ends so quickly,<br>
Come hold me, Akinyi<br>
And I'll let her go.<br>
    </p>
