    <p>
      One or two packets,<br>
For a friend - not just anyone, mind you.<br>
"Hey, can I have a packet or two?"<br>
He asked the store clerk as he rushed off to work.<br>
Yes, work - no need to ask too many questions.<br>
Just a minute for a friend,<br>
"It's cold out and please hurry,<br>
My friend is waiting for me on the couch."<br>
I'll be discreet in case I take too long -<br>
Which of course I shouldn't.<br>
Hurry so she won't have to wait too long.<br>
And keep the change,<br>
Thanks to the rubber latex,<br>
We can be safe, at least for a while.
