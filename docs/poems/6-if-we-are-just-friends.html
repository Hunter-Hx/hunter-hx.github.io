    <p>
      If we are just friends,<br>
Let's keep a clear boundary,<br>
And not fall into temptation's sin,<br>
Leaving me in despair, and you with doubt,<br>
Let's enjoy each other's company,<br>
And be content with what we're about.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
If we are just friends,<br>
No need to call me late at night,<br>
And speak of things beyond friendship's light,<br>
But if you need me, I'm here,<br>
To lend a listening ear.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
If we are just friends,<br>
Don't hurt yourself with false hope,<br>
But cherish our bond, don't let it elope,<br>
For friendship is a precious treasure,<br>
That can last a lifetime, without measure.<br><br>
    </p>
