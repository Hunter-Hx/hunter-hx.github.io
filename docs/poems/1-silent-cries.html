  <section class="poem-content">

    <p>
      In shadows cast, where sorrows reside,<br>
A symphony of anguish, silent cries.<br>
Unheard by ears that wander astray,<br>
Yet echoing within, night and day.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      In whispered whispers, a tale untold,<br>
Heartache's masterpiece, in secrets unfold.<br>
The weeping soul, masked by a smile,<br>
Bleeding tears unseen, mile after mile..<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Through empty corridors, the echoes chase,<br>
Whispering laments of a hidden grace.<br>
In solitude's embrace, they softly weep,<br>
Silent cries, their secrets they keep.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
But let us listen with attentive ears,<br>
To those unspoken sorrows, born of fears.<br>
For within the hushed melodies they bring,<br>
Lies the strength to heal, the power to sing.<br><br>
    </p>
      <p>
So, let us lend a caring ear,<br>
To the silent cries that often appear.<br>
For in the depths of quiet despair,<br>
Empathy can mend, and love repair.
    </p>
