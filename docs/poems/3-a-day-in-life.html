  <section class="poem-content">

    <p>
      It's yet another day,<br>
To make moves with snakes,<br>
Part ways with gods,<br>
And talk gospel with the devil,<br>
Listen to love songs with broken hearts,<br>
Pretend we are okay and;<br>
Sit around the table with backbiters<br>
Pin blames on situations,<br>
Create animosity with pure hearts,<br>
And conceal the evil with righteousness<br>
Talk to the evil ones,<br>
And plan on how to slay our wrong doers<br>
And them who are better than them(us)<br>
Hate the benevolent<br>
And love the malevolent<br>
Leaving a gap for the adiaphorous<br>
It's yet another day,<br>
Just like any other day.
    </p>
