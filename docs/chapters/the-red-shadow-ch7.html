    <p>The magic of the old works perfectly. After I had laid everything to Dayo, she helped me locate Mutinda. I woke up the next day with joy of knowing that I’ll be with my friend again. I’ll be smiling again. All the good things were going to come my way. I trusted it with my all.</p>

<p>Wairimu came to bid me goodbye. I took out my phone and took some pictures of her. Oh god! That girl knew well how to pause for capture! We took some selfies and ’twas done. She escorted me for some distance but I wasn’t happy with it. Remember my bag? Well, I couldn’t pick it and let her see so I just decided to be escorted knowing I’ll have to sneak back and pick it. For an almost half a mile, we hug, kissed and she said goodbye. I felt really bad. I wanted it to last but it was somehow wasn’t. She walked her steps and the fragrance of her home-made cologne graced her back.</p>

<p>I waited until I was sure she was gone then I sneaked back to pick my bag from where it had spent its night.</p>

<p>Dayo had told me Mutinda was in Numbi, a small town located next to Alexa. It was a one hour walk or twenty-minute drive. I decided to walk since I had no money left.</p>

<p>When I got to Numbi, I started to trace him from every detail the old woman had said. When you get to Numbi, ask any person you’ll find there to take to street Bazenga. After that, turn left of the tall building, Nkisa, and match your steps straight to door number seven. You’ll find your friend there. He’s worried about you too. It was like the old woman had arranged everything using her black magic. I did exactly that and I found my poor fella waiting for me, seated in a verandah like some old boss. Smiles when I saw him. A friend and a crime master. Joy in the air!</p>

<p>Mutinda had grown. He wasn’t the way I saw him last at the bar. He started to grow beards and his voice and nearly everything had changed about him.</p>

‘How are you, big panda?’<br>

‘Fine like never before. Get it bruv.’<br>

<p>Mutinda had a house and not just a house but a cool one! Never underestimate the underdogs, their luck lies in the hand of… their own.</p>

***

I now had one of my lost treasures.<br>

‘How has life been?’<br>

‘Very hard. I thought you were arrested.’<br>

‘Arrested? For what?’<br>

<p>‘Don’t talk much. How did it go with the girl I gave you?’</p>

He first smiled and sighed for a while. ‘She’s my wife,’ he bellowed like it wasn’t real.

------------------------------------------------------------

‘Wife?’ I eagerly asked trying to find more.

‘Yeah. And I’m very happy. I’m praying for you too,’ he said smiling as he got up towards the kitchen.

‘Coffee or tea?’<br>

‘Coffee.’<br>

<p>I still couldn’t believe that Mutinda married. At that very moment I thought of Wairimu, the grace of the savannah. But she wasn’t anywhere nearby. I took out my phone, looked the pictures we had and that calmed my heart, at least.</p>

‘I was very worried about you and now I’m very glad,’ Mutinda said. He was trying to act like an adult but since he had a wife, well, all grace was unto was he said.<br>

<p>We took some coffee as we talked about our pasts. Mine was horrible. Mutinda’s wasn’t quite. There was a knock on the door and there she was, Mutinda’s better half, the one I had introduced to him at the club. Holy heavens she looked very different. Beautiful in her dera dress but not like Wairimu in her silken clothes. In the look of the face, there was none to choose.</p>

<p>My mind drifted to back when I first saw her, she was very different. A uniquely different. Perhaps my sight was poor then.</p>

<p>She entered and I guessed she knew me already. Not from the club but I suspected Mutinda had told her of me. There was no essence for introduction. She reached to Mutinda, a wink and he followed her into the kitchen. Whatever they discussed, I never wanted to know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was still a mountain to climb; escape the Holy boys. I heard they devoted all their time to find their betrayer; me. I could always see their social media posts of threat. They weren’t going to stop and neither was I going to let them catch me.</p>

<p>Later that evening, we had a walk with Mutinda. I told him of the holy boys, showed him a photo of us and she identified one saying he is his neighbor.</p>

‘You what?’ I asked terrified.<br>

‘Why, is something wrong?’<br>

<p>‘Everything is wrong,’ I explained to him how and why I met the latter, how I betrayed them and why they were searching for me. Mutinda’s place wasn’t any safe. That neighbor could find me any minute.</p>

‘I think you should just go back home, my friend.’<br>

‘I’m not. I’m not.’<br>

‘It’s the best thing to do.’<br>

‘At last, I told him I’d go but I wasn’t so sure that I truly wanted to.’<br>

<p>‘Vaya Con Dios, my friend,’ Mutinda had thrown some little Spanish his wife had taught him. And I left, to the unknown, again. And I live their till now. Anytime the holy boys find me, that’ll be my last on earth.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------


<p>Melisa’s rage had died. She wasn’t a threat as Holy boys were.</p>

<p>I had escaped the matrix, but for long? I wasn’t born for the crime, I was born to be in the red shadow of my mom.</p>
