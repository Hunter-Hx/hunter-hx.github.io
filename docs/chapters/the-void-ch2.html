<p>Sofia followed her into a drinks store. They sat on a bench right in front of the merchant’s counter. A few people were drinking — two near the entrance, their lips moving rapidly. One of them raised his left hand and swung it through the air, demonstrating how the murder had occurred. His companion gasped and shivered, the glass in his hand visibly shaking as the gruesome story continued.</p>

On the other end, others were completely unaware of what had happened; they sipped, chuckled, and carried on.<br>

<p>Sofia and Hope had been sitting in silence for over two minutes when the seller appeared — a tall, well-built black man, his beard trimmed uniformly. He wore a black leather jacket with a white silk T-shirt peeking from the unzipped front. He smiled at Hope; she smirked back.<br></p>
“Hello… what can I get you, kind ladies?” he asked, his voice warm, not directed to either of them.<br>

They looked at each other.<br>

“I’ll have club soda,” Hope said.<br>

“And the guest?” he asked, turning to Sofia.<br>

“Club soda too, kind sir,” she replied. Her voice felt small — weak, vulnerable. Hope stared at her blankly.<br>

<p>Silence filled the room as darkness crept in. Night was falling, and a few more people trickled inside to clear their minds. Only footsteps and clinking cups spoke with the tables, along with a few coins tossed onto the counter. One could mistake it for a deserted place.</p>
After serving his new customers, the merchant brought two club sodas and placed them in front of the girls. Then, unexpectedly, he sat directly opposite them.
<p>He could read the dread in Sofia’s eyes and the stoic calm in Hope’s. He looked at Sofia with pity and an urge to help, though he knew words were never the solution — they never were. He took a long sip, exhaled deeply, as if ready to speak, when suddenly Sofia turned to Hope with distraught eyes.<br></p>
“Why are we here?” Sofia asked.<br>

“Enjoying your drink?”<br>

“It’s getting late, and I really need to get home,” Sofia said.<br>

“Home? I didn’t know you had one.”<br>

Sofia felt the sting but ignored it. “Look, I’m happy living there.”<br>

“Happy, huh?” Hope asked, her tone thin with sarcasm.<br>

<p>The merchant watched them closely. He sensed the direction Hope was steering the conversation and didn’t like it. He leaned to his left, resting his head on his hand.</p>

“You know, my kind ladies,” he began, “I am tired of everything — of life most of all.” He paused.<br>

Sofia noticed his right hand. Three fingers were missing, cleanly cut. The image lingered in her mind before fading.<br>
“I am divorced,” he continued, “and—”<br>

“What’s your name, kind sir?” Sofia interrupted gently.<br>

“Adira Max Kei, my kind lady.”<br>

<p>Before Sofia could speak again, customers began pouring in. Voices called for drinks. The merchant excused himself and walked away to serve them.</p>

“What do you think about the letter?” Hope asked.<br>

“What do you want me to say? That I should give in to suffering? I never deliberately choose suffering — it just arrives.”<br>

“It’s not giving in. It’s freedom. It has nothing to do with your past either. I know you’ve suffered. We all have — some more than others. From grad school to this… to living in a consecrated house. Or maybe you haven’t learned anything about suffering at all.”<br>

Sofia stayed silent.<br>

“I’ll take that silence as a no. Or a yes. Whatever.”<br>
Sofia traced her finger around the rim of the glass. “What I’ve learned is that suffering doesn’t build character. It doesn’t teach you anything. Most of the time, it just hurts.”

“Now that’s a graduate,” Hope muttered.<br>

“I’m not really willing to do it,” Sofia said, glancing at the returning merchant.<br>

“Do you even have principles, Sofia?”<br>

“Tell me about the incident at the church,” Sofia said quietly.<br>

The merchant froze. “The incident? You mean the killing?”<br>

<p>He hesitated, then sat again. “As I was saying, my kind ladies, I have no home. Six months ago, the government chased us out of our house. We had lived there for nearly four decades, and suddenly it became government property.”</p>
He gestured toward the back of the shop. “Now I sleep here. That torn mattress — that’s my bed. My wife divorced me. She said I was a bad father.”
“I had no money,” he went on. “I still don’t have enough. My rent is due tomorrow, and the landlady has no patience left. She’ll chase me out. Where would I go then, my kind lady?”

He fell silent for a moment. Sofia felt a dull ache spread through her chest. She pitied him.<br>

The merchant glanced at Hope. Their eyes met briefly before Hope looked away. He turned back to Sofia.<br>

“I had three children — two boys and one girl. The eldest is a teacher, just a few miles from Peter’s Street. He does not recognize me as his father anymore. He sees me as a failure.”<br>

<p>His voice cracked. He rubbed his nose quickly, as if trying to wipe the words away. Hope watched him with faint irritation and then stood to fetch herself some water. The clock above the counter read half past eight.</p>
When she returned, he continued.

<p>“My second-born was called Clara, until a few months ago. One day she disappeared. Six months later she came back with money — a lot of it. I thought our troubles were over.”</p>

He let out a weak laugh.<br>

“But when I called her by her name, she ignored it. She pretended it wasn’t hers. I didn’t know she had changed it. Why would she tell me? Me — nothing.”<br>

<p>His voice faltered again.</p>

“One evening she left the house, and I followed her. Along Peter’s Street. It wasn’t a crime — a father can follow his daughter.”<br>

He paused, staring at the counter.

“She had a grey card. That’s when I understood. People were calling her Hope. She had become famous. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. But at least she is alive.”
He wiped his eyes.

“She drinks here sometimes. Even brings her clients. I never speak. Not because I can’t — because I choose not to.”

<p>Silence settled between them.</p>

“And today,” he added quietly, “my youngest son was involved in a murder. Hope’s own brother.”

He smiled weakly.<br>

“God must have created me as a mistake. Something to laugh at when He is bored. A punishment for my sins — though I do not know what they are.”

He sighed.<br>

“I am tired. It takes all the strength I have just to stay alive. But still, I hope for tomorrow. Because, my kind lady… what else is there?”<br>

“Death,” Hope said coldly.<br>

No one spoke.
Hope stood. “It’s late. I need to get back to work. My clients are waiting.”<br>

<p>She leaned close to Sofia and whispered, “Think about the letter.”</p>

Then she left.
<p>Sofia stood abruptly. “Tell me about the church killing!” she shouted, and the glass slipped from her hand, shattering against the floor. But Hope was already gone.</p>

Sofia knelt and gathered the pieces, placing them carefully on the counter as if apologizing to them. Then she walked out.

Later that night, she sat on her bed with the food she had bought, untouched. The room felt smaller than usual. She thought about how cruel life was, how unevenly it punished people.

Somewhere between thought and exhaustion, she fell asleep.<br>

<p>A knock woke her.</p>

She couldn’t tell how long she had slept. The knocking was persistent, deliberate.<br>

“If I open this door and it’s someone I don’t know and they kill me,” she muttered, “at least my soul will be free.”
Her heart raced as she approached the door. There was no lock. Only a chair and, balanced on it, a yellow jerrican of water.<br>

Don’t open it, a voice inside her whispered.

For three months, people had been dragged from their homes and murdered. The thought passed through her mind without fear. She was ready for death.<br>

She lifted the jerrican down and opened the door.<br>

The corridor was swallowed by darkness. Her candle threw a trembling light outward. A silhouette stood with its back turned, as if ready to leave if she never opened.

Sofia gasped, pressing her hands to her chest. The figure did not move.
“What… do you want?” she whispered.<br>
The figure turned.
“Why so glum and fearful, Sofia?” Hope’s voice said, followed by a crooked smile. She held a small bag, something inside it shifting like a bowl.<br>
“Will you let me in, or are you going to watch me freeze out here?” Hope asked lightly.<br>

“I thought you were used to standing in the cold,” Sofia replied.<br>

“Not like this.”<br>

<p>Sofia stepped aside. Hope entered, counting her steps toward the bed. Sofia closed the door and sat at the opposite end, leaving space between them.</p>

Time passed. Neither spoke.<br>

“I thought I should stop by,” Hope said eventually.

“That’s thoughtful.”<br>

“Do you know what time it is?”<br>

“Not really.”<br>

“A little past two. I checked the clock on Peter’s Street.”<br>
“What brings you here at this hour?”<br>

“I brought you food. And I need a place to sleep.”<br>

Sofia smiled faintly. “No thanks. I’m full.”<br>

“You’ll need it tomorrow.” Hope slid the bowl under the bed.<br>

“I’m straight,” she added quietly. “Will you let me stay for the night?”<br>

“I don’t care if you’re straight or not. What happened to your house?”<br>

Hope’s smile stiffened. “Aren’t you more interested in the church murder?”<br>

“I am.”<br>

“Good. I’m not telling you tonight. I’ve had a rough day.”<br>

“Mine are always rough.”<br>
<p>Hope’s eyes wandered around the room. A basin of dirty clothes near the door. A few rags on the floor. In the corner, a yellow jerrican beside a cold jiko and unused utensils.</p>

On the bed, three ropes stretched from one end to the other — makeshift hangers for Sofia’s clothes.<br>

And beneath them, three rags.

Dark.<br>

Stiff.<br>

Still wet with blood.<br>

Sofia noticed Hope had seen them. She lowered her eyes.<br>

“It’s okay,” Hope said softly.<br>

“I know,” Sofia replied. “I keep it to myself. And it hurts.”
