      Have you ever had that feeling of wanting to be someone else? Well, I experienced that in a way I never expected. You see, I was a typical church boy, just like most of us during our innocent childhood days. I had mastered all the gospel songs in our local language and knew a smattering of English. And when I say smattering, I mean I could barely string a few words together. But hey, I was the church boy, the holier-than-thou type.
    </p>
    <p>
Dreams of becoming a pastor always danced in my heart. Every day, I aimed perfection, trying to memorize a verse or two and grasp some meaning from it. Then came Sunday school, my chance to shine. The moment I would step up and present my newfound wisdom, I knew I would be rewarded with something beyond imaginations—okay, maybe just a few scattered claps, but to me, they felt like a five-factorial standing ovation. It was pure bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was good at that first phase. If there was ever a time I truly believe I could catch a glimpse of heaven, it was during those moments. I had my sight set on divine greatness, armed with my limited English vocabulary and an unwavering desire to be the holiest of the holy. Little did I know that my journey towards holiness would take an unexpected turn, with a twist that would leave even the angels scratching their heads...
    </p>
    <p>
They say time heals, but it pays no mind to man. It soars on its own wings, indifferent to your actions or inactions. It’s the ultimate game changer of our lives. I developed new interest; girls and watching crime-related stuffs. I was the top-notch guy within a short time. Oh, Pablo Escobar, the man with money making magic! Everyone liked him... Well, not the government, of course, but hey, I liked him. I’d spend hours watching his crime documentaries. I mean, who wouldn't be drawn to all that wealth?Cha-ching! But watching him didn't make me rich. I didn't find Escobar's secret stash while sitting on the couch. Richness don't diffuse through screens, you know? If only it were that easy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Every time I was from church or anywhere, I’d spend some time to watch one documentary of Pablo. It just felt super cool. Watching a rich dead guy and imagined if the money was all mine. I was truly two in one; holier but diabolic. Can someone truly embody holiness while constantly surrounded by the deafening noise of crime?
    </p>
    <p>
    As we grow, our tastes evolve, and some disappear while others emerge within us. My motivation for attending church and school underwent a humorous transformation. Church became the place to catch a glimpse of enchanting Lavender, and school was where I could behold the captivating Jennifer. These two girls held absolute sway over my actions making me as fluid as water. Now, don't jump to conclusions; it wasn't ablutophobia, fear of bathing, that haunted me. Instead, I become a dedicated bather, hoping to impress these two queens with my impeccable cleanliness.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I played a cunning game at such a tender age! But, let's face it, was really a brilliant strategy when I couldn't decipher whether either of the girls liked me back? I was like a young Sherlock Holmes, analyzing every move I made with the hopes of winning their hearts. It was like trying to solve a mystery without any evidence! Monday to Fridays I could see Jennifer at school, which made her a bit more common figure than Lavender. But I still liked her. Not more than Lavender. No. I liked them equal. I liked them without telling them. I liked being with them. I felt whole by just sitting next to either. It was the form of love; I guess the only genuine love that ever existed. Love that had no expectations like today’s. Childhood love slaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hilarious Friday morning, I decided it was time to spill the beans to Jennifer, my classmate. I thought it would be as easy as pie, but little did I know I was in for a roller-coaster ride. I spent my entire night concocting a brilliant strategy on how to confront her with my awkward feelings. It was like preparing for a top-secret mission except this was going to blow me off. Now, I'm not a fan of plan B’s but this time I had to embrace it because, hey, I was determined to get the girl.

Plan A: convince her to be my escort home, and then the magic would follow.<br>

Plan B: oh, sneaky one! Pretend we were playing hide and seek, snatch her bag, and run home, hoping she’d chase after me. Desperate times call for desperate measures.<br>

Plan C: This was my masterpiece. Inspired by some romantic movie, I was going to drop one knee and propose!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yep, love can turn us into absolute goofballs. But seriously, I was betting my chips on hope. The next morning, I woke up with a grin so wide, I could've caught flies with it. I felt like I owned the world, or at least a tiny bit of it. All I needed now was to win her heart, and I was ready to conquer any distance or time in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I arrived at school a whopping 30 minutes earlier than usual, and you should have seen my buddy Sam’s face—it was priceless. "Hey, Peter, you practicing some motivational guru's secret routine?" he quipped sarcastically, trying to be a mood killer. Ugh, Sam knew I despised those motivational speakers and their miracle stories. They always brag about flunking math one day and becoming geniuses the next—like they stumbled upon some ancient math spell or something. If only they knew the real math, the one that gave me migraine just thinking about it. I couldn't stand their tall tales. But you know what? This time, it wasn't about the speakers. It was about me taking charge of my destiny, even if it meant getting to school early, something I’ve never done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, though, had other plans. When we're having fun, it flies like a rocket, but when we are waiting for something good, it's slower than a snail at a marathon. I swear, from 6 to 6:30, it felt like I aged a whole week! I eagerly waited and waited for her arrival, my heart pounding like a race car. But alas, she never showed up. The disappointment hit me like a ton of bricks, and I tried to console myself, thinking maybe she got caught up with some punishments or something. But deep down, I felt broken. How could my first love slip away from me so effortlessly.
    </p>
<p>
  As each agonizing hour crawled by, my tears were confirmed—she was absent. My heart sank further, realizing that it would be two more long days until I could catch a glimpse of her again. To make matters worse, she wasn't even a member of our church, making these chance encounters all more precious. The day had started with a radiant smile, full of hope and excitement, only to fade away into a gloomy cloud of sadness. Oh, why did fate have to play such a cruel trick on me? I walked home bored with every staff I came across. I could feel the earth insecure. I was surely the saddest boy on earth. I was sad than Arturo, the polar bear. The only deference between Arturo and I was that Arturo had lost his partner Pelusa but me, my partner, Jennifer didn't show up. The similarity however, was that we were all depressed about love.
</p>
    <p>
     Living in two phases of life has never been a cakewalk. On one hand, I had this inner crime-mastermind vibe, and on the other hand, I was trying to juggle flaming swords while balancing a tightrope made of spaghetti! Picture this: me, sitting in church, daydreaming about Pablo Escobar and his thrilling adventures. Oh, the struggle was real. I knew crime had the potential to pay big bucks. I mean, illegal stuff can fill your pockets faster than a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter. And let's be honest, I was tempted to become the ultimate bad boy. 
    </p>

    <p>
     But then there was this tiny, soft spot in my heart that kept whispering about love, school and church. So instead of turning into a full-fledged criminal mastermind, I ended up becoming a self-proclaimed ‘ladies’ man’. School was a whole different story. I wasn't exactly the brightest bulb in class, or the second brightest, or even the third... okay, let's just say I wasn't winning any academic awards. Hurts? No, it didn't hurt me. But hey, I proudly held the position of being sixth from bottom. That was my shining achievement, and I even joked with myself that I deserved an Oscar award.
    </p>
<p>Now, my best friend girl, gave me a nickname ‘Hunter.’ Why, you ask? Beats me! Only she knows the reason behind it. Maybe she saw my potential for both crime and charm, who knows? All I can say is that my life was a wild comical ride, navigating between these two contrasting worlds. And hey, I was the star of my own show, even if my mom didn't quite see it that way. But deep down, I knew I was rocking the Hunter persona like a boss, despite the chaos and the hilarity it brought into my life.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I’m not ashamed to say that surely my childhood was worse. Kids do awful thing sometimes, but mine was to the extreme. My mom knew it. I was the stubborn kind from birth. I enjoyed being stubborn; it was just something that lived within me. I however, respected her. Never did I ever turn against her. My stubbornness was for other guys who proved to be tough.</p>

<p>After saying goodbye to school and church at only 14, life took its turn against my being. It cursed my footsteps. Nothing worked out. My mom never wanted me anymore. I disobeyed her for the first time ever. Leaving school and not going to church felt like I’ve joined some cult. I was surely left for the world to do whatever it was going to do on me. I remember her words on me: "my son, your life will shamble and crumble into rumbles." We never really know how important something is until it slips past our fingers.</p>

<p>My mother never denied me a place to sleep, though. Every mother care for their children no matter what they've done; my mother was the kind. She'd cook and provide me with just almost all basics: water, shelter, food, care... just to mention. One condition however stood on our way: she wasn't talking to me and I couldn't dare talk to her unless I wanted to be kibogoyo as young as 14.</p>

<p>My father wasn't always around. He wasn't home, he wasn't anywhere. I didn't know him; I doubt if he knew me. My mother must have known him. I remember one day I asked her:<br>

"Where's dad?"<br>
"He's on errand," she replied.<br> 
  "But will he be back?"<br>
"Yeah, he will. I just don't know when."<br>
"Okay call him. I want to talk to him and tell him something."<br>

<p>My mom stayed silent. I knew I had crossed boundary. I asked a wrong question, but I wanted to see my father. I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to be like other kids who bragged about their fathers.</p>

"Your father won't pick up your call"<br>
"Why?" I asked with much more concern, eyes popped.<br>

<p>She posed for a minute and then she removed a paper under the couch. On it was a poem, an elegy poem. It said:</p>

<em>Beneath the moons veil,</em> <br>
<em>I find solace in the night,</em> <br>
<em>Nurturing my souls seed,</em> <br>
<em>When longing embraces your heart,</em> <br>
<em>Remember, I'll be there in form of a tree.</em>


    <p>It's only later that I realized the words were paraphrased from Elegy by Jimmy Osborne. It all rang on my brain; my dad had died long time when I was young. And the tree was actually the one that grew next to our house; my father's grave. My mother talked less but read more. She could spend some time to just read. She read a lot. I was the direct opposite of her. I never loved books. I saw reading as a burden.</p>
<p>
However, I liked two lines from William Ernest's poem Invictus: "I'm the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul." I didn't know the impact those words had on me but I just liked them. That was all I liked about reading. Nothing more, nothing less. It wasn't all until a new chapter creased upon my face—I was lost in the dark shadows...
