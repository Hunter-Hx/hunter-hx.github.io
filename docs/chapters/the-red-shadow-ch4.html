    <p>Darkness was starting to peep in. We boarded a fucking matatu to Alexa. I could see every other guy cool and relaxed. They were used to such things. I wasn't. Did they know I was under 18? How was I going to handle a woman twice my age. I prayed. I silently prayed. As the taxi was strolling out of Maadi towards Alexa, I saw someone who looked like Wairimu. Without deception of my eye, she was truly Wairimu. I felt guilty. I hoped she never saw me.</p>

We were there. Land of Lands.<br>

<p>'We'll take that route,' Mkuu said as he pointed towards the road that led to a fancy well-built road. I wasn't familiar with Alexa since I had never been there. But hey, lack of money and problems took me there. We walked down town to where the girls were. 'Four will go this side and four will go the other side.' And we separated.</p>

<p>I had these group of 'I don't give a fuck guys.' They were monster humans. As expected, in Alexa you'll never miss a woman on the gate of her flat. They were always there waiting for people, but for that very day, I was the people, we were the people. As we moved, we separated further. And finally, it was my turn to find one.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road was a wall fence that separated Maadi and Alexa. It was a bit developed than any other part of Alexa. Alexa wasn't big. It was small and tidy. People living there weren't tidy though. One walked in to me holding a thousand shillings on hand. 'But you are too young,' she commented. That raised too many questions on my head. As I was thinking on how I could abort this mission, I heard the other women laughing. I couldn't see them clearly since the darkness paved over their ugly faces. Honestly, none of the women were attractive. You eat while you close your eyes.</p>

<p>This woman was middle age, probably 29. She'd wore a white dera clothe that covered over her body. The white color was probably to attract more people. White is clean, yeah? But I knew at the back of my mind that wasn't the case. I'd given myself out to be killed for just lacking a dime. I convinced myself I can do it but as I approached her gate, I had pled to let me go.</p>

'I'm sorry to...,'<br>
'Sorry for what?' she interrupted.<br>
'Just let me go and I will never be here again,' I pleaded.<br>

<p>She quite seemed understanding. She therefore let me go telling me that if one of my crew finds out, they'll kill me for betraying and getting lost with their money. She let me walk out of the gate. Just outside, a stone throw away was Melissa; I could see that she was trying to make out who I was. With motorbikes passing and dimming light on my face, she took centuries to notice me. Then finally; 'That's him. The boy I told you ran away with my money, the boy who stole my cash. That him. Boys, go after him.' I heard her voice screaming and pointing at me. Menh! I froze. She's gonna get me killed. I'll be on news, young boy killed for robing an innocent woman. Shit.

<p>I immediately crossed the road; I got a sight of a wall fence that separated Alexa and Maadi but it was very tall to jump over. I was a man on the loose. Escaping Melissa and The Holy Boys. Either would find me and kill me. Of course, I wasn't killed. I covered some distance and I could see a bunch of guys after me. They carried all sorts of weapons. I doubted if they didn't have guns. Since I wasn't familiar with Alexa, I found it very hard to maneuver out. Every path I took led to a wall fence. I was running to the unknown and from the unknown. I passed over hundred households and could still see those guys behind me. Fuck. I caused all these to myself.

<p>But Alexa was a well-lighted area; bulbs fixed on people's homestead; this made it a bit easier to run... I never thought I was that quick. As I moved out of the quiet town, street lights were starting to fade off. There was little light. I could see them sniffing holding their torches. They could get me any moment. Buh, haah, they were dealing with an athlete champ.

<p>As I crossed the wall that separated the two towns, I felt like I was free. It felt like Jaguar Paw in Apocalypto, after crossing the mighty river to his home forest; I am Jaguar paw. This is my forest and I'm not afraid. I knew Maadi was my town. I grew there and knew all the go paths and the tiniest hole that'd make you tumble. I am hunter, this is my town and I'm not afraid, I said to myself.</p>

<p>Shockingly, I could still see the guys determined to get me. They weren't getting tired of the boring chase. But that was just the beginning of the run. A fugitive in my own land. They were going to find me no matter what. I had two options; run, or fight. But I already chosen to run. I wasn't going to give up on it unless I was completely capacitated or dead. I created my own marathon; I was the first and they were runners-up.</p>

<p>When fate is against you, nothing you do can free your poor self. You can run but all can just be in vain. Me being in my home town didn't help me at all. Maadi was not developed as such. It had rusted iron roofs and some shanties made of grass. Electricity was something that most people didn't know of. But as the saying goes; in every poor village, there must be a rich man. That our rich man had everything, not merely all but he had things that most of us never heard of. He had those old cockroach cars used in World War two. We nicknamed his car Olwenda since it moved very slowly and sometimes could fly, not fly but generally be swayed by winds as it moved. The engine had this kind of black smoke. You'd probably think that someone's house was on fire. But no, it was Ogutu coming back home in his Mazda as he called it.</p>

<p>Ogutu's backyard is where I was hiding. The backyard was filthy to be honest. It had those sorts of rat, big rats that'd devour you whole! They never looked friendly. But one had eyes that made me remember my old friend Mutinda. Ooh! Poor Mutinda was dead in my thoughts and imaginations.</p>

<p>The night took forever. I had my phone inside my pocket but I could risk getting it out because they could see light and catch me. I could feel it vibrating. I had no clue who was calling. Holy boys, I thought. They had lost track of me. I was fast. They gave up and retreated back to Alexa. I pat myself on the shoulder for having won the war. But it was all just the beginning of my suffering....</p>

<p>There was a town, Nadir, bordered Maadi to the east, I knew it well. That's where my school was located. I had friends there; I knew quite some people. It wasn't like Alexa. It was a place of good men and women. With no survival means, I was looking for a job at one of the people I knew. Luckily, I found one rich guy who employed more to look after his cows and pigs. Holy Jesus! Pigs. He was welcoming. He made hell feel like home. We agreed on a salary of 10 bucks. I think that was just enough since I had no family or anyone to look after. It was only for credit and some little clothing.</p>

<p>Back at home, I didn't know anything going on. I didn't think of going there either. I was learning my own way out. But the chase wasn't over yet.</p>
