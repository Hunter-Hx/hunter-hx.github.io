    <p>Three days had passed and my job was going on nicely despite the fact that I hated doing it. One day, I was strolling the internet searching for memes and watching some reels. The life there had made me forget that I was on the run. I was scrolling when a WhatsApp notification popped above my screen. It was The Holy Boys. I swiped down to read the message without opening it so it would seem like I never read it. It said; you can never run from us. We’ve got your contact and soon we’ll get your location. For fuck’s sake, where did they get my new contact? Was someone spying on me? I knew I wasn’t safe where I was. My boss, however, didn’t know anything. He knew I was a good boy, but of course I was.</p>

<p>I had two things weighing me down, I lost my friend Mutinda and the Holy Boys were after me, Melisa too but as love beats all, Wairimu never left my mind and I hope she never was.</p>

<p>The Holy Boys played a nice game; they weren’t going to post my picture giving a reward for whoever found me. They weren’t going to do that. They were professionals, Melisa wasn’t. But despite Melisa posting my pic, I knew she wasn’t going to find me. And I was sure of it.

<p>I was giving the pigs food and cleaning their shed when one managed to escape. I went after it to try not to lose my job should it get lost. Since I was a champ, it didn’t get too far before I caught it. But of course, I beat it thoroughly. All my rage I poured into it. When the owner came, he noticed it. Red strips cutting through his fav pig. He acted like he saw nothing. He always played cool.</p>

<p>That very evening, a motorcycle had collided with another. People gathered to see what was happening. I went too. Amidst the small building crowd, I saw Mkuu and his crew was there with him. One of his members, Nkato, was the one involved in the accident. I kept my head low not to be seen and I was lucky not to be seen. That gave me signal that they were never too far from me. I had to quit my job.</p>

“Boss, I’m going home,” I started<br>
“You’ve worked only for two weeks,” he replied<br>
“Yeah, but I just need to go.”<br>
“Okay, go.”<br>
“And my money?”<br>
“One month isn’t over yet... I’m not giving you anything.”<br>

<p>I pleaded with him to give me half of the money. I begged heavens for it and finally, he gave me half with a little shopping. I stepped out the gate not knowing where to take them. I therefore decided to start my small portable shop. Within some few hours, I had sold everything. The burden was reduced by one. I had enough transport to take me about 250 km where neither Melisa nor Holy Boys could find me. But that was an inconvenience in that I was still looking for Mutinda and I never wanted to go too far from Wairimu. I was stranded.</p>

<p>Sitting down under a tree, I reflected back on how I’ve ruined my life; the small quarrels with mum, running from home, joining the Holy Boys, a dreadful night with Melisa and now, I’m on the run.</p>

<p>I wanted to go back home to mum, but I heard she wasn’t at home. She’d disappeared too?</p>
