    <p>
      Sofia raised herself and sat on the edge of the bed. She watched Hope, who lay deep asleep, and wondered how one could sleep so peacefully with impurity around them. Her mind drifted, and she remembered what her mother once taught her about purity—about partners and sex.
    </p>
    <p>There’s something called a soul, my daughter,” her mother’s voice echoed in her head. “That soul is linked to one man, whom we call a soulmate. Sleeping with multiple men destroys that soul, rendering it useless and impure… and one will never see heaven.”</p>

<p>The voice lingered and disturbed her for a moment. She ignored the rest of it.</p>

<p>She did not want to wake Hope. She stealthily tiptoed from the bed to the door, opened it slightly, then tiptoed back.</p>

“What are you doing?” Hope asked, rubbing her eyes with the back of her palm.<br>

“Didn’t want to wake you,” Sofia said in a shrilly whisper.<br>

“Well, another day, another struggle, right?”<br>
    Sofia chuckled softly. “What time does your father open the drinks store?”<br>

“You mean Adira?”<br>

“Will calling him father kill you?”<br>

“Yes!” She paused. “The shop is always open.”<br>

“Okay. I wish I had my father,” Sofia said sadly.<br>

“We always wish for things… that eventually—anyway, the shop is open.”<br>

“You know there’s only one word I said less than any other kid at school,” Sofia said as she reached for the bowl under the bed.<br>

“What’s that?”<br>

“Father. Other kids used to say it… my father bought me this, my father said that… I never got to do or say any of those. Because life happened.”<br>

    <p>For a moment, Hope felt her. But what she had no control over wasn’t going to make her sad.</p>

“I’ll go to the shop,” Sofia said.<br>

“Want an escort?”<br>

“I’ll go alone.”<br>

“As you wish, dearie. I need to clean yesterday’s mess. Where’s water?”<br>

“Two blocks that way. You buy.”<br>

“Okay.”<br>

<p>Sofia changed her clothes and walked out toward Peter’s Street—to the merchant’s shop. As was her habit, she dipped her hands into her pockets and let her mind wander. The idea of asking for a job crossed her mind, then faded.</p>

She walked for a while and realized she was on the wrong route. She had been talking to herself and lost her direction.<br>
    "I hate myself," she whispered as she turned back to the right way.<br>
<p>At the stores entrance she stood, the door was slightly ajar and some murmur sounds came out. It was too early to drink but who cares? The gently pushed the door and got in. She scanned the room,she couldn't see Adira. She advanced and sat on the bench they had used the previous day. The place smelled loneliness and her life's troubles started to unfold in her eyes. She viciously shook her head,closed her eyes tightly and let the picture wonder off her memory.</p>
Moment later, Max walked in. She noticed him immediately. She got seizures and she shivered,cold run through her body. Her heart skipped with the mixture of anxiety and happiness. She saw salvation, someone to cure her loneliness.<br>
Max walked to her bench and with a smirk, tapped her gently in the shoulder.
"So early, huh?"<br>
"Yeah, well, sleeping doesn't help," she responded.<br>
"Except for the rich. You alright?"<br>
"Yeah."<br>
<p>Max turned and looked at the guys who were drinking in his store. He forced a smile.</p>
"Do you think they noticed that I am around?" he asked.<br> 
"I noticed when you weren't. Does that count? Sofia asked jokingly and they both giggled.<br> 
"Want a drink?"<br>
"No."<br>
"Tea?"<br>
<p>"No thanks. I just came to see your, sir," she said as she adjusted her chair.</p>
"What do you need?"<br>
<p>Sofia was silent. That was a hard question. It showed so much care in her perceptive. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place talking to the wrong person. "I am sorry about yesterday," she said.</p> 
"About what?"<br>
"To know that Hope is your daughter."<br>
<p>Max's eyes were downcast, he felt shame and hate. They were both trying to avoid each other's eye contact.</p>
"I went to see my son?"<br>
"How's he?"<br>
"His eyes are distraught. He's pale and he's... vindictive."<br>
"Can I go see him?"<br>
"He's been arraigned in court in three days. There's no doubt where he's going."<br>
<p>All that time, Max stood, as though frozen. One of his customers called, as he walked off to attito then.</p>
<p>There's was a clearer contrast in the room. Grief, desperation hoovered on one side as happiness and entertainment shoved on the other.</p> 
In the thought and silence, Sofia got lost and unknowingly said "I came to look for a job."<br>
"Oh, you can help me sell," Adira said.<br> 
"Thanks, I am trying to live another life. This one is exhausting.<br>
"But this one is the only one you've got. This life's the only one you've got."<br>
"I know. How I wish I could change it."<br>
<p>As time went by, many people were coming in to clear their heads while others were leaving.  Sofia was still stark on her chair, unmoved.</p>
Adira was busy selling his drinks. Sofia walked to give him a hand- bench to bench, Sofia supplied and collected the used glasses.<br> 
"How do you know Hope?" Adira asked, after ensuring that all his customers were served.<br> 
"There's a letter she sent me asking me to join her and other girls on the street."<br>
"Have you joined her?"<br>
<p>Before she could answer, a high-heeled pitched sounded from the door entrance. A relatively well dressed lady, wearing a miniskirt that was a about four inches from her waist. She had a black silky blouse, tightly revealing her body- the firmly standing breast, and on her eyes, black sunglasses. It was easy to know who it was.</p> 
She walked in to Sofia's bench and ordered Americano.<br>
She turned to Sofia. "I didn't know how to lock your door."<br>
<p>"It's not lockable," Sofia whispered as she did not want people to hear her. Every folk in this neighborhood was dirty.</p> 

<p>Adira looked at her daughter with regret and disappointment. He constantly tapped his middle finger on the bench to destruct himself from the harsh reality that was right in front of him.</p>
"I have never seen you like this," said Sofia.<br> 
"Well, this is my work attire. You've gotta attract you know."<br>

<p>For a moment, Sofia and Hope gestured and Sofia them followed Hope to the farthest corner.</p> 
"I really need you in the team. Elevate yourself. Make your own money."<br>
<p>Sofia took a deep breath. Her head spinned. One thing for sure made her heart race, how boldly Hope had come to her. It was much easier to read it on the paper than to be actually to told it face to face.</p> 
<p>Joining meant she was going to rid off her dignity. But what dignity? Rid off her pride and reputation, but what reputation? Respect for society?  On this specific idea, there were some things she had to come to terms with and not question for example that client was client and she had to adjust her taste.</p> 
Some minutes had passed, Hope was still staring at her blindly. Amidst the silence, Sofia said yes, unknowingly.<br> 
"Yes?" Hope inquired with quite of a relief.<br>
<p>"Yes, life has no dignity," Sofia said and paused a little, "I'll get rid of my dignity," she added. Hope tried to collect the fragments of her words but nothing appeared to make sense to her.</p> 
Hope looked at her without blinking or averting her eyes.<br> 
"I can get the grey Card," she said eventually, not stressing out anyway word, but the words grey card came out feeble, perturbed and horrid. She took a deep breath and left.<br>
Adira watched her without any word. 
<p>Inside her room, a wave of sadness occupied her. Her torment of life annoyed her, and gravely, the idea of selling herself to earn a living made a wretch. She recalled all the interviews she'd attended, all the local job requests she'd asked for, none had come out, and none seemed to be coming out any time soon.</p> 
"That I should sell my body to earn a living...that prostitution pays...pays well, so I'll have to wait for a pulp man and just..." She couldn't finish her monologue. She lied on her bed nearly 30 minutes without doing anything, just staring at the roof.<br>
She rose from her bed, walked to the door and slightly opened it.<br> 
Whie sated and thinking, she saw something tied and place next to her pillow. She reached it and unwrapped it, inside were some money. Perhaps Hope had left them on purpose.<br> 
<p>She bathed and walked back to the merchants shop.</p>
<p>Adira was finalizing washing the used glasses when Sofia showed up. He looked at her and read her expression, regret and fear as always. Anxiety consumed her and keenly, one could see her trembling. He called her in, slided a glass to her. Sofia gently pushed it away, just an inch. Her face terrified him. They looked at eachother other, two broken people trying to fix eachother.</p>
"She asked you to join her?" Asked Adira.<br> 
"Yeah. And I think I will," the words came out of her mouth with a little nudge.<br> 
<p>Within the confusions of despair, a short man, about 4' 2" strolled in the room and matched straight to Sofia. He didn't flinch. Adira looked at him with disgust, then forced a smirk.</p>
<p>He stood stoically and stared directly into her eyes with empathy. He dipped his left hand on her back pocket and fished out a letter which he handed patiently to her and he left. His sparked shirt waving as he walk away.</p> 
Sofia shivered and shuddered, her mind run to the letter she had received earlier. She knew, with no doubt it was from Hope.<br> 
She looked at him. A tense atmosphere and racing heart.<br> 
"Open it," He said.<br>
"No. It's from Hope, I am sure,"<br>
"Why would she write you a letter, she just left less than two hour ago," Adira observed.<br>
"I know it's from her."<br>
"Maybe it's not."<br>
"No one writes to me."<br>
"It's only by opening it that you'll know."<br>
<p>Sofia's had shook as she opened it. On the inside the white envelope was a piece of paper, it read "from home." Reading a few words ahead, something caught her eyes in shock. Tears dropped.</p>
"Mother dead, Come home," it read. Everything shut down in her. She dropped it on the desk, he picked it.<br>
Sorrow.
