    <p>Six days had passed and I planned to travel back to where I had lost Mutinda. With him, I could easily find Wairimu and with that, I was set for a new life, maybe. Since I had quite some cash, I was on.</p>

<p>All those six days, I was at friend's place, Mango. A hospitable friend except his mom. My friends always had problems with their moms. They never liked me and I never cared to even think of it any minute. I always trolled.</p>

<p>I picked my small briefcase which I had packed some clothes and matched out. I walked some distance and bordered a taxi to Nyanyi, a small market where most of lost people were often found. I thought Mutinda would be there but he wasn't. Where was he? And Wairimu? And the Holy boys? I didn't know where any of them were at that very moment and I guess they didn't know where I was either. I thought now it was time to forget my friend and move on with life. I thought maybe he was living a good life and so I never wanted to interfere having gave him a wife. Within the market, I picked some stuff to eat and decided to go back to Dayo feigning a visit with the obvious motive; talk to Wairimu.</p>

<p>I took another vehicle that let towards Mutinda's home so I'd take the route we used the previous day we met Dayo. Within the van, I saw someone that looked like one of the holy boys. I took out my phone slowly and checked a group photo that we had taken earlier and for sure, it was him, Majengo, the quietest of the crew. I quickly pulled over and alighted not to be seen. This was now the fourth time they were almost catching me. I had to find a safe way.</p>

<p>I walked the distance to Dayo's home. It took me about four hours to reach there. As I approached the gate, I saw someone standing there. It was Dayo. She saw me and I could see her smile. She was happy to see me.</p>

'Grandson, you came back,' she said as she hugged me.<br>
'Yeah, I just missed you and Wairimu,' I lied.<br>
'Ooh, she's inside, go and see her,' she said.<br>

<p>I walked in and there she was, Wairimu, busy doing some laundry. She saw me and for a minute she was stunned. She didn't expect me to be back. I walked to her and helped her with the bucket of water.</p>

'You came back?' she asked smiling.<br>
'Yeah, I'm back for you,' I said.<br>
'Ooh, I missed you too Peter,' she said.<br>

<p>The afternoon went on well and I told her all my struggles. I didn't hide anything. I told her about the holy boys and Melisa. She was shocked but she promised to keep it a secret. I felt a relief having told someone what I was going through.</p>

<p>As evening approached, I asked to use the washroom. Inside, I looked at myself on the mirror and I saw a different person. I was no longer the church boy. I was a hunter. I was on the run. I had to make a choice; to stay or to move on. I chose to stay with Wairimu and Dayo for a while.</p>

<p>After finishing my business, I felt like I was being watched. I tried to be calm but it was hard to. I heard footsteps and then, 'Hey, is everything okey?'</p>

'Everything is fine, just had a running stomach and now I'm good,' I said as I walked out, toilet's door slamming behind me.<br>

'It's so weird to be in here, right?' Wairimu started.<br>
'Nope, its fine. Its full of serenity everyone needs.'<br>
'Things aren't always what they seem to be,' Wairimu said making a step ahead.<br>
'What do you mean?'<br>
'I'll tell you a story one day. Dayo needs me, lemme go help her.' She walked as a wave of suspense hovered around me. Things aren't always what they seem to be. What did she mean? Was she suffering here? I hope she wasn't.</p>

<p>It had been three hours and I still couldn't say what brought me to them. I was ashamed of asking for help. A place to sleep and how to find my friend. I had heard that medicine men and women stayed in the forest and somehow, they helped, a lot. I was now going to ask for that help.</p>

<p>Before I could walk into the kitchen and ask for what brought me, Wairimu happened to have been coming my direction.</p>

'What did you mean by what you said.'<br>
'Nothing, I just said it.'<br>
'No. You are lying.'<br>
'Yes, I am. Dayo knows you are lying and she won't tell you unless you open up,' she said covering her eyes from the cold of the blowing wind.<br>

'Well, I'm going to tell her. Wanna come with me?'<br>
<p>'Nah! It's your burden,' she said smiling headed the opposite direction.</p>
