    <p>
      <p>Sofia picked up the letter to read it again. Its source and legitimacy troubled her. Why would someone she knew nothing of send her such a disturbing letter? Though the source was questionable, that did not guarantee its illegitimacy.</p>

<p>Recalling a few moments back, her mom and none of her relatives knew her address. Neither of her friends knew her address either, except, of course, Karen. She turned her eyes to Adira, who was more troubled by the news than anyone. His face wrinkled with weakness and his heart raced. He knew how painful it was to receive such sad news.</p>

<p>Still seated at the desk, Hope appeared, dressed as she was earlier. She was carrying a paper bag that appeared to have a bottle in it. She walked up and sat next to Sofia. No one talked. Sofia knew, at the back of her head, why she had come back for her—they were to go and register the grey card.</p>
    <p>Adira looked at Hope with disgust. His mind slowly unfolded his life’s horrors and he left for the back of the store.</p>

<p>Hope turned slowly and looked Sofia directly in the eye and, without hesitation, Sofia got up and Hope followed her to the road—the road that led to the registration center.</p>

Hope waited outside.<br>

The room was furnished with the newest brandings and the best furniture in the town.<br>

“Take a seat, please,” the attendant told Sofia, and she sat on the chair opposite her.

“I’m Joy. How may I help you?” the attendant continued.<br>

The question sounded stupid to Sofia, but she let it slide.<br>

“I would… uhm… I would, uhm… like to… could I get some water, please?” Sofia stuttered.<br>
    “I would… uhm… I would, uhm… like to… could I get some water, please?” Sofia stuttered.<br>

“Sure,” Joy affirmed as she picked a clean glass from the tray. She sensed fear and terror in Sofia’s voice—and the anxiety.<br>

She came back.<br><br>

“You okay, Miss?” she asked, handing the glass of water to her.<br>

“I don’t… know… but I think I am,” she forced a smile.<br>

“What’s your name and how can I help you?”<br>

“Sofia,” she stuttered.<br>

“Sofia.”<br>

“I came to register as a prostitute.” The words felt heavy, but her face showed slight relief after she said them.<br>

“I am sorry, Miss, but that’s not how we call it.”<br>

“What do you call it?”<br>
    Commercialisation.”<br>

“Wow! Why? To hide its ugliness?”<br>

“No, Miss.”<br>

“Aren’t those two words the same? Like differentiating existentialism and nihilism? Or kleptomaniac and a literalist?”<br>

“Okay, mum.” Joy paused and pulled out a new file, placed it on her desk, and picked out a new box of pens.<br><br>

“Your full name, please?”<br>

“Sofia Glim.”<br>

“Gleem.”<br>

“Glim.”<br>

“Identification number?”<br>

“24783438398533hp,” she said briskly and repeated it again.<br><br>
    “Hp? You must be really young—just graduated, I guess.”<br>

“Doesn’t matter, does it?” Sofia asked sarcastically.<br>

“Reason for joining?”<br>

<p>“Isn’t it to make money? Look, my mother died today… or yesterday, I don’t know,” she responded and said a few more things to avoid the conversation from horrifying her.</p>
  

Joy’s face showed empathy, and her heart ached a little. She worked on her computer and within minutes, a printer wired on the left corner began printing the grey card.<br>

“I’ll have you sign here,” Joy said, showing her.<br>

<p>Sofia held the pen with shaky hands and hesitated to put her signature on it. She looked at Joy, and Joy looked back at her, eyes full of emotions rather than words. She closed her eyes as she was about to enter a horrifying reality.</p>
   <p>She drew a few scribbles—and that was her signature.</p>

“Thank you,” she said unknowingly.<br>

“Your card is on the printer. Pick it up and please never leave it behind whenever you are going to work.”<br>

“You don’t charge anything?” Sofia asked as she picked the card.<br>

“Don’t worry about it. You are free to leave.”<br>

Sofia walked out holding the grey card—new, unused, and pure. Yes, pure.<br>

<p>Hope was waiting at the door with a smile. She looked happier than before. Sofia walked a few more steps toward her and opened her arms to hug her. She knew Sofia’s problems were going to end. Sofia thought about her mother, with less feeling than usual.</p>

“What next now?” she asked.<br>

Hope was silent.<br>
    “Where do we go now?” Sofia asked.<br>

“Ajx.”<br>

“Ajx? The police station?”<br>

“Nope. AJX Prison.”
