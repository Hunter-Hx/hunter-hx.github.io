    <p>
      We walked down the road in silence. Mutinda wasn't taking to me. He was jealous that Wairimu chose me instead of him. But for how long were we gonna walk on a pin drop silence?</p>
'So what?' I started the conversation<br>
'You know,'<br>
'I didn't choose her, she chose me,'<br>
<p>Mutinda hated himself. He never wanted to be him. His face was the reason. He feared ladies too. How was I going to help my fellow? Nonetheless, I never lacked ideas. The only idea I lacked then was where we were going to survive.</p>
'I'll find you a girl,' I assured him. I could see his black folded face smile. He was somehow cute when he smiled. He was so easy to lure.<br>
<p>We were friends. Small stuffs like girls weren't going to ruin our friendship. We'd walked and now we were drained and tired. We had reached Nywari town; seven miles from our village.</p>
'Where to spend our night?' I was always the first to ask.<br>
'Let's go inside a club,'<br>
'You got any money?'<br>
'Yeah. I got some two hundred shilling from the old woman's bag.' Mutinda had stollen Dayo's money.<br>
<p>Two hundred wasn't enough to sustain us at the club. I felt some guilt but I couldn't do anything. We needed money. And even God knew. In life you must have funds.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, it was a promotion day. Entry fee was eighty shillings. That meant we were only left with forty bob.</p>
<p>Since it was my first time at a club. I didn't know what to do and what not do. Dance? Watch people dance? Dance alone or with a girl. I was certain that Mutinda too has never been to a club. But hey, we were there to do whatever guys were doing there.</p>
<p>I set my eyes on a lot of guys dancing. Young girls, young men, old women, old men... everyone minded their business. On the far conner of the entrance door were three huge ladies. Their table was filled with drinks. Walichafua meza... with the pounding loud music, you could only see their lips moving. One thing was for sure, those ladies had money. On the other end were other group of people. Not rich not poor; they were there; sharing whatever any sponsor would bring along. In the middle, was the dancing field ground. Everyone had their match. Swaying to the beats of the music. And then... there was us, no girl, no one to talk or dance with. Mutinda and I were stranded.
<p>First two hours went on smoothly. I was enjoying being there. Mutinda never ceases to forget.
'Hey you said you'll find me a girl,'<br>
'I know. Do you have any money left?'<br>
'What for?'<br>
      'These girls won't have you when you have no money.'<br>
'Ooh no, just bring me one. I'll try to fumble out...' Mutinda concluded.<br>
<p>I was figuring where to get him one girl. I wanted to find any girl since Mutinda didn't have any taste. He had longed for a girl that he was now desperate to have any. I walked amidst the crowd trying to find a girl. There was none.</p>
'Bro, girls are yet to arrive, relax I'm finding you something legit,' I told him. He smiled.</p>
<p>Poor Mutinda was smiling. Ooh I'll have a girl; I know he said.</p>
<p>Midnight was there already. I had to find the girl for it was freezingly cold. But the stench of people sweating had swallowed all the cold. I walked around once again; this time I found a lady; not old not young. She was there, after all she was female. That's all Mutinda wanted. Lucky for me, she was like Mutinda. A perfect match I'd say. It was her first time to be at the club. Her appearance really showed she'd never been to a club or even some makeshift club. She wore sweater and a tight-jeans. But with the sparkling club lights, it was not clear what color she wore. Her body was enormous and her upper body had swallowed her lower body making her unbalanced. I couldn't really tell the color of her skin. Her mountainous breast flopped over her chest dangling every time she moved and... that's all; her beauty was quite unique. I walked up to her. Briefly, her name was Norah. I said whatever had brought me to her; hey my friend over there is interested in you... those were the key words. Always hard to say but always speak directly what you want! She gave in. Mutinda found love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as I was struggling for Mutinda, he had dozed off amidst the pounding club music.</p>
'Hey mate! Get up...'<br>
'Something good?'<br>
<p>The lady was surprised. Mutinda was so much confused. He didn't know when to speak or when not to but that didn't bother me whatsoever, he wanted a girl, I brought him a girl. Talking and seducing was up to him now.</p>
'I'll get back to you guys,' I said as I walked away. I had to find my own since Wairimu was miles away; million miles away, yet so near in my heart.<br>

<p>***</p>
<p>Within, the ladies who were next to the door were still rooted there. They didn't move. They did nothing; only talked shit. I was starting to feel some hunger. I always starved... Walking past them, one clutched my shirt. She was be the leader of the female park. I tensed. Did I walk to a restricted place? I asked myself way too many questions as I tried to remain calm and composed.</p>
'Want a drink?' one huge dragon asked.<br>
'Ummah... no I'm okey,' I said slugging.<br>
'You can't come here and not drink...'<br>
'I was just passing when...'<br>
'No,' one cut me short.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing rung in my mind. I've only heard of whores at club parties looking for someone to lure and sleep with but never have I ever come across one or interacted with one. She introduced me to her so-called crew. Damn those other women were ugly. The one who yanked my shirt was at least better with the club lights sparkling. They were even much prettier every time lights swayed their faces. I had left Mutinda in trouble thinking I was safe; I wasn't. Mine was even worse.</p>
<p>She said her name was Melisa. They offered me a drink but since I never tasted alcohol before, I wanted to experience drinking. I comfortably drunk with them. Midway, I was now over drunk. I couldn't see properly. I saw everyone as a girl. I didn't know where I was... I passed out.</p>
<p>At dawn, I was a bit in my senses. I couldn't see Mutinda. I didn't know where he was. My consciousness had been ruined. I woke up in a car. Heading to nowhere; on the driver's seat I could see a woman. Huge. Her phase was not the one I'd talked to at the club. She was...uhm...not beautiful. She was taking me to I don't know where. My heart raced. I couldn't cry out since my energy had waned from the excessive alcohol I took. She drove in silence. Once again, I passed out.</p>
<p>I woke up on the couch. Her tapping me gently made me wake up. Where am I? She offered me a drink. Milk and bread. And then...all hell broke loose.</p>
'I know you are scared,' she started, 'I won't hurt you. I'm just here to stay with you and treat you like my own kid. I'll do whatever you want me to do for you. Want an iPhone? I'll get you one. Want new Jordans? I'll get you one... I'll get you everything. But on one condition, you won't leave my house and won't disclose to any one where you are. Bye. I'll be back,' she concluded as she walked out of the house locking all doors and windows behind her.<br>
<p>I couldn't scream. I could only stare and gaze.... The only way I could beat her was to do whatever she wanted until she trusted me one day, then I was going to make my way out. If that woman wanted a kid, why did she have to kidnap me? did she thought I had no home? Despite all the difficulties, I found it cozy. Holy shit, she provided everything.</p>
<p>Night came. In my mind I knew I was going to sleep on the couch. But of course, I slept on the couch. At midnight, I'm not sure of what time exact. I had someone touch my leg. It was Melisa. That's when it all rung in my mind. She was a whore. She wanted to sleep with me. I was helpless since she had a gun.</p>
'Do as I want or I'll use this on you,' she said holding the gun... I don't remember exactly what happened but I woke up on her bed; covered with a duvet...that's all I could recall. I feel the guilt till today. How I'd fucked up to the point of losing my virginity to on old woman.<br>
<p>The room was devoid but the door was ajar. I wasn't seeing her. I dashed for my clothes which were on top of a drawer, put them on and pepped from inside to see where she was. She was busy cleaning some utensils at the corridor. She had just woken up. Still wrapped in a white towel which was so light. I felt goose bumps.</p>
<p>With the plan of escaping still on my mind, I didn't know where to follow. To walk out I must use the corridor. I sighed. Prayed. For ten minutes I just stood there, pepping and pepping and pepping. Out of blue, she heard her dog bark. She wheeled to confirm and that's when run out tumbling on the utensils that were on the highway. I nearly fell but I was on a mission; to escape the problem I caused me. I hated dogs but I loved the moment her dog barked. It wasn't done yet. A big problem was remaining. The entire compound was fenced with electric fence and the gate was locked with an alarm padlock. That meant the moment I'd touch it; the alarm will sound and I'll be caught. Fuck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as she was checking her dog. I was hiding next to a wall where I could see her coming. She took forever to check her dog. If it wasn't for the gate, I'd be out already. But I wasn't. I was not even close. How will I get out here? I asked myself several times. I'd climbed the fence no matter what but I had no energy to do it following what happened the previous night, and it was electric.</p>
<p>Something then clicked my mind. She left the keys on the bed. I had to dash back and get the keys. This woman was lazy. I ran and got the keys but before I could dash out again, she was there continuing to wash her fucking utensils. I shook my head so heard thinking it was a dream, but no, man, it was a crushing reality. I climbed the bed and pretended to be a sleep. She walked in but couldn't notice that my clothes were not on the drawer where she'd left them. Her dumbness was my joy. I saw her by the side eye; she was picking her bathing net. Women with water.</p>
<p>As she walked in to the bathroom. I now had to leave. No sooner had I thrown away the blanket to make a run for it, than she walked in to pick her pants.</p>
'Awake? Where do you want to go?' she asked<br>
      'Uhm, it's just hot so I thought I put the duvet away,' I said freaking.<br>
'Okey,' I'll shower then we'll go out,' she said as she walked out.<br>
<p>I waited a little longer until I ensured that she was actually bathing and not joking. With the keys in my pocket and some cash, I dashed out for the gate. I was freaking as I tried to find the exact keys that opened the gate. I didn't want to make a mistake lest the alarm sound. Luckily, I found the right key; insert, turn clockwise and it opened. I left the keys dangling on the padlock there and run.</p>
<p>I ran not knowing where I was going. Tired and weary in the middle of a forest, I rested for an hour or so. Fished out my money, counted and it was five thousand. I had to find Mutinda. In the process of thinking where I'd find him, I dozed off. In my dream I could see Mutinda handicapped. He was restless. He was accused of rape. Poor Mutinda was tricked by the girl I brought him. I could see media teams capturing Mutinda and with no minute, he was live with a tag line; MAN CHARGED WITH ABDUCTION, RAPE AND MURDER. And I was just having a glimpse amidst the crowd. I saw Mutinda and felt apathy for him. I know he cursed me for bringing him a girl that later had him get arrested. He hated me for being a fake friend. I saw the police commander addressing the state, his words that I clearly recall: this is a serious offence and the judge would be lenient to sentence you to death by lethal injection. Chills ran down my spine as I thought how my only crime friend would die a painful death. Dear God...</p>
<p>Before I could finish my dream, I heard footsteps and of some kids passing by. I'd slept on their footpath. It made me at least escape the lie that; if you finish a dream you die. I got up on my feet dusted myself off as that dream re-flashed across my face. I cried. Yeah. I cried, honestly. But it was all a dream.
<p>As all that unfolded, I forgot I was hungry. I haven't eaten for almost fifteen hours and that was a lot as I always starved. I had to find Mutinda. I didn't know I'd find him. What if that all I dreamt was a reality? What if Mutinda died for real? Holy God! Keep my friend safe.</p>
<p>I walked to the road leading to a market where a taxi pulled over and picked me. Everything at the moment felt like shit. I hated myself. 15 minutes, the taxi pulled over and I alighted, of course having paid. I was in a hurry to find Mutinda but I didn't know where precisely. I was now getting overwhelmed with guilt; having lost my virginity to an old woman, probably my mother's age, I cheated on Wairimu and now I've lost my only friend. Reality was crashing me so hard. I didn't know whether that woman was also stalking after me. I had no phone so I couldn't know what she was up to. I was in a dark world despite the sunny day. The streets didn't smell good without Mutinda. It was all chaotic.</p>
<p>It's been now three months without seeing him and my five thousand was long finished. As I was walking down the bustling streets, I spotted a group of individuals, they looked like drug dealers. You know it's prohibited to walk past a gang because they might think you are undercover police. I gathered my guts and walked directly amidst them. I wanted any job to survive and I had given myself for any that I was going to find. I felt a sense of frustration in their faces. I had trespassed.</p>
'Get him here,' one said pointing directly at me. I froze. They are going to kill me, I thought. But of cause, they didn't kill me. I did not want to resist or act stubborn. I walked to them without a second. If they kill me, it's all right. I said to myself.</p>
<p>Their leader told me all. How they were looking for a new recruit to fit in their squad. They were seven people. Each had a role and so there was one vacant place, I had been very lucky. As all was unfolding, one huge guy come from behind holding a piece of paper on hand. He handed it to me; it had a bold tittle; 'RULES OF THE GAME.' Yeah, they called crime a game. The rules were outlined. The one that out did them all was; NO BETRAYAL.</p>
<p>Well, I was in but I was petrified. How I'm a gonna survive this? I was the youngest in the team. I could see every other guy bearded and huge. I was just a mere fish amidst the sharks and I had to be tuff; the world wasn't my mom! They called themselves the Holy Boys. Ironically from what they did. The leader had no name, all I heard them call him was Mkuu. What the fuck is Mkuu! I didn't like that name at first. But hey- I had a job at least and you could not have never wished to meet me then.</p>
<p>The moment I said my name, they didn't like it. They didn't like names that were on the bible. They connected them to chances of getting caught. I remember none of them had an English name leave alone biblical name. So, one guy suggested my crew's name. They all approved it. Lozia was the name, they claimed it mean adopted. I didn't like that name. Shit!</p>
<p>There was one requirement, I had to find a smartphone which I could use to take picture should they be needed. But I had no money but the crew offered to give me one on credit and later cut it from my salary. Everything was set. Me and my new phone. We sat on a wall fence next to Galaxy school where Mkuu was figuring what we were going to prey on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as I was strolling through internet, I saw a photo of the woman I had run away from. She was looking for me. She had posted a picture of her and a drawing of me next to it. She claimed I was his son and whoever helped her find me was going to be rewarded some huge amount. The drawing wasn't perfect enough for anyone to be suspicious that it was me. But I knew she was going to find me and kill. I had stolen her money and ran away without her consent. I had to be far from where I was or else, she was going to get me.</p>
<p>Quite a number of days folded. We didn't undertake any deal; I was familiarizing with the crew. Playing some cards and chess. Then the day come. I didn't know whether we were going to rob a bank or do something more sinister. I was green.</p>
<p>Evening come and we were to go and handle whatever task we come across. We gathered around as we waited for our leader to brief us.</p>
'This is the plan for today,' he started. 'Well walk down the street of Alexa, some women are waiting for us on the streets. They aren't whores, they are just women who need sex and they pay you. The more you go, the more money you'll come out with and later well share equally. You can't survive the streets alone.'<br>
<p>I didn't like it at all. Alexa was a town in the middle of some fancy but creepy markets. It's known by the large number of ladies who live there just for sex and they pay you. It's a wealthy town. Beautiful women are found there, not for marriages but for sex and you are free again. It just like 'Hey, want some dose,' and the lady would say yes and take you to their house. It's not always a safe place and some men get killed and their bodies dumped on a septic tank. It's always a love and crime center. Its nicknamed 'Kilo' implying that first you make love and later get killed. That's what Alexa is.</p>
<p>I feared Alexa from birth. I never wanted to step a foot there. I feared those ladies who were killing men. Every time you'd hear over the news that three men were picked on the streets of Alexa. Cause of murder is still unknown. The government didn't always expose what they do since it an agreement. 'Want to wrestle up some grub?' 'Yes'. The government wasn't bothered whatsoever.</p>
<p>What I thought was going to be a ride had turned out to be the most things I hated'; going to Alexa. I knew we'd rob a bank and get money. But no, I was reduced to a mere young whore. Holy shit. I screamed inside. Since I never wanted to betray them at first, I was going to handle the so-called job.</p>
