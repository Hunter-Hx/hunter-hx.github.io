    <p>
    Even though I was stubborn, I wasn't energetic. I was the weak kind. Things related to going to shamba, digging and doing all that, I wasn't able to do. I knew how to hold a jembe firmly, but the energy that I was to use wasn’t there; it wasn’t nowhere within me. That made me flee from home because my mom had given me punishment of digging a whole acre of land. Failure to which, I was not to be seen. African parents! I therefore, opted for a simple way: running away with no mind of coming back, which seemed pretty cool for me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my mom wasn't worried about me. I had disrespected her and that built a sort of animosity. She never wanted to beat me and she never did. She always said, "choose your path and do whatever you want." I had fled to one of my friend's home, Mutinda. He was my old friend and my former schoolmate. Mutinda had helped during a sport's day when some huge guy wanted to beat me. From that day we become close friends.</p>

<p>Mutinda’s home was some distance from ours. A two-minute walk where you’d borrow salt in case yours run out. But Mutinda’s never lend any one salt. They were always on their own—a pretending to be royal family. A family that’d see a fancy dress and take one year paying for it in installments. By the end of that payment, you’d have grown that the cloth didn't fit you well. That’s what they were. A royal but not royal family.</p>

<p>I was now standing at Mutinda’s door hoping he’d hear my footsteps and open up. His mother never liked me; she always said that I was a disgrace to her son. She thought I could even poison her son. What she didn't know was that I wasn't a killer; I couldn't poison my friend. Not once nor twice, she’d chased me from her compound. An impossible woman! But now I was at her place again, trying to find refuge. I called for Mutinda to open up. He couldn't hear me. Fuck! I could hear his mother opening her door. Her house was some few meters from his son's simba. I was starting to freak out. If this woman finds me here, I'm dead—I mean dead. She can even report me to the chief claiming that I stalked her while she was bathing. This was how impossible that woman was.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mutinda’s home was situated in a plain devoid of any trees or bushes to provide cover. The only available hiding spot was behind a less-than-ideal wall. I saw her and dashed for the wall. She was coming directly towards me. Her dog followed her. I feared dogs. Sweat started to drop off my face. Fuuuuuuuuccccck! Before she could reach me, I heard her voice: "what are you doing there?" she roared. I almost answered with freak. She repeated her words with much more intensity. I was now sweating, seriously sweating. I'm caught. Today I'll be at the chief's baraza for a crime I didn't commit. Fuuuuuuuuccccckk! I was going to be charged for dishonoring an impossible woman. I was going to be reported for entering her bedroom without her consent. Fuuuck. Ooh no, I thought.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, she was calling her son who slept till that late. 6:30 am was late for that woman. She banged Mutinda’s door with fury. Ooh poor Mutinda. Meanwhile, I was still hiding behind a wall watching scenes unfolding like a movie. Thanks to their dog who was too hungry to notice me. I am safe, for now, I said to myself. I survived.</p>

<p>Mutinda didn't notice me yet. For how long was I going to stand behind a wall which wasn't mine? For how long was I going to hide in a home which wasn't ours? I’d fucked up. How was I going to talk to Mutinda when her mother had already ruined my plan? I sat on the verandah where I was hiding. Out of blue, memories of Lavender and Jennifer hit me so hard like a hammer. Were they thinking of me? It has been two months without seeing the latter. My feelings were surely starting to fade off. I was neither happy nor sad; I just wanted refuge.</p>

<p>An hour passed and I was still hiding away from that woman. All I was able to do was shifting my sitting point. From verandah to ground to verandah again... I did that for a while and I was bored already. I therefore, made my mind. I was going to greet Mutinda’s mother and then talk to Mutinda. I was really daring. "What if this woman chases me with a machete?" I asked myself. Back home I knew what my mom was thinking. She was planning to get me home. Lure me with some few parental talks and then... I wasn't going to have my teeth again. I couldn't dare walk home. She was fuming...</p>

<p>As I had planned, I walked to face the impossible possibility. I had all the reasons to do it. "If you don't do it now, you'll add problems for yourself," I convinced myself. I dusted myself off. Gasped some air. Took a deep breath and then wheeled towards Suzzy, Mutinda’s mother. She saw me and I knew she saw a devil's incarnate. A ghost arising from the sea. She knew and I knew that we never liked each other. Why did she hate me so much? I matched, but before I could greet her, she folded her nose. Ooh no. My greeting wasn't answered. It didn't bother me in any way. Mutinda couldn't come off her mother's feet. He was being lectured. He slept till late. He had not washed utensils the previous day. He had not... Poor Mutinda was in trouble as I was.</p>

<p>My stomach was starting to rumble. I was starving. I hoped to get some tea from Mutinda. But it never came. My mind first ran home. I wasn't missing home; I was just hungry. I imagined drinking tea at that moment, cracking some jokes with mum. But it was all a fantasy. I could hear the intensity of Suzzy's voice; she was sizzling. Mutinda had made her angrier. My source of refuge was sending me to another refuge. But to where? Mutinda was the only friend I trusted even though her mother didn't like me.</p>

<p>Time passed and finally: "Move out of this house if you think you are big enough for the home chores." Suzzy’s voice was final and Mutinda couldn't say anything beyond. He was shocked. Our parents were really petty. What they weren't aware of is that we were never threatened by their words. Why would we be, yet if you talk while they are talking, that’s being disrespectful. If you listen to hear them complain, they'll still say you are disrespectful. Solution out was to leave home, until they were calm again. And that’s what rung in Mutinda’s mind, I knew. For the two hours I’ve been at Suzzy’s, I haven't changed a word with Mutinda. We saw each other, but never talked. Suzzy caused all these!</p>

Mutinda dashed out. He saw me. I saw him. I saw his face; he wasn't smiling as he used to. Personal faces really look terrible when they frown. Ooh Mutinda, is that the reason why you smiled more often? Mutinda had his own face—I mean his own. With that, he’d saved me on sports day and now we were in trouble with him. "Who’ll come to our rescue?" I asked myself.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Matching out of the wooden gate, I never thought how life was going to be. A life without money, life of the streets. I looked at him.</p>

"Hey Mutinda, how we gonna survive out here?"<br>
"Don't worry, we shall...?" he said with more certainty that shed a flicker of hope.<br>

<<p>Two youths, fourteen and seventeen, out for I don't know what; my heart felt like a hammer. Fear cripped my soul but I wasn't going home not until it's calm again. But for how long were we going to be out?</p>

"Hey dude, let's walk straight to that road," he said pointing to the direction heading towards market.<br>

<p>Time was flying, noon was approaching and the sun was scorching. It shined on Mutinda’s forehead and bald reflecting rays to my eyes every time I looked at him. It’s funny that he was starting to be bald at seventeen. Nevertheless, genes don't care where they fall. That was and is nature; beyond everything.</p>

"Are you not feeling that heat on you?" I asked nonchalantly.<br>
"Insult?"<br>
"Not really, bro," I answered.<br>

<p>After walking for quite some distance we saw an old woman probably walking to her home. She was carrying a paper bag and some firewood on top of her head. The hot sun had made her weary and tired. "A nice spot to get ourselves first meal," I heard Mutinda say. I disagreed with him. Why rob that old lady of her belongings? No! "Let's go help her carry her stuffs hoping she gives us a drink," I spoke.
    </p>

  <p>
    We walked to her. She wasn't scared of us. She didn't know us. We didn't know her either. Situations however, made us know each other. She didn't say her name; instead she said we can call her Dayo, meaning an old woman, a grandmother. First sight and she trusted us already. Kind and humble woman. Mutinda carried the paper bag which he already knew had bananas inside and I carried the firewood. They were very heavy; no wonder Dayo was straining to carry them.</p>

<p>She led us to her home. A place of serenity. Her home was situated in the middle of nowhere, only birds chirped. She was staying with her young granddaughter, probably seventeen. A beautiful queen of the savannah. I felt like composing a poem for her; describing her beauty. She adorned herself in a timeworn silk gown that cascaded over her body. Its fabric clung to her curves, accentuating her alluring form; seductively curved waist with sizable bulging hips. Her ample bosom proudly held its ground, akin to ripe like a wild fruit. With each step, her feet were adorned with sandals that matched perfectly with the hue of her chocolate thighs, teasingly peeking out as she moved. Her radiant complexion seamlessly merged with the golden sunbeams filtering through the intricate patterns of the trees above, imbuing her with an ethereal glow. Her lips adorned with a touch of delicate color, were like a freshly bloomed rose petal, merged well with her dimple. I'm not talking about holes kids. A dimple that you'd yearn to touch. A goddess of beauty she was. She made me forget that I was starving.</p>

<p>The old lady was welcoming and so was her granddaughter. She offered us a drink: scalding hot porridge with yams. Since we were starving, that seemed like a lottery. Mutinda couldn't speak a word. He was stunned with that beauty. He admired her, I knew. As we sat under the tree, a breeze caressed us from everywhere. I liked that place, addition to the fact that there was a girl there, not just a girl but a beautiful one; ooh I loved that place even more but it wasn't my home. I couldn't finish even a cup of porridge. You don't act hungry when you meet a girl on first sight, right? I just took enough and I was full—I mean not full full but I was good.</p>

<p>Then lucky for me, I didn't care about Mutinda; the queen joined us. She was carrying a cup of boiled milk and yam. She matched directly towards us and sat next to Mutinda who was drowning in a world of porridge and yams. A little of an awkward silence prevailed between us. She glared at me, then at Mutinda.</p>

"Don't be surprised," she said, her eyes downcast; pretending to be shy.<br>
"Hi," I said, trying to suppress my already trembling voice.<br>

<p>Out of blue, Mutinda raised his eyes and introduced himself and I.</p>

"I'm Mutinda. He's Peter," he said pointing at me. He still had a piece of yam in his hands.<br>
"Nice to meet you. I'm Wairimu," she said with a lovely smile. Ooh this girl.<br>

<p>She heard Dayo's voice calling from the kitchen. She walked off leaving her milk and yam for me to hold. I was in heaven already. Meanwhile, Mutinda had whispered on my ears that we were not going to leave. But I knew what he had in mind: stay and sweet talk Wairimu, but I wasn't going to allow. This was my only golden chance. I wasn't going to spoil it.</p>

<p>As she walked off, the images of Lavender and Jennifer appeared on my mind. But one thing stood out for sure: Wairimu was beautiful than the latter. Immediately, their images were completely deleted on my mind. I wasn't thinking of them anymore. They were like an old box of memories...</p>

<p>As I was meditating, enjoying every bit of my being there, I heard: "Peter, could you please give me a hand?" It was Wairimu. But the way she pronounced my name was just amazing. P...i..terrrrrr—this was surely a love language, I guessed to myself. I walked and helped her carry the two chanks of pilled firewood to the kitchen. Mutinda watched me with a questioning eye. He imagined I was him. But no, I was me. I was Wairimu's.</p>

<p>We spent almost two hours enjoying ourselves that we forgot that this wasn't our home. Mutinda stood up to walk around the new homestead. He liked venturing new territories. He liked nature. As he walked away, Wairimu walked out of the kitchen to join me. I couldn't feel any better. Her beauty had become even more appealing. The silked clothe had clung more on her that I could see everything through. This was home, this was Wairimu and there I was.
  </p>
  "This isn't a nice place to be at, right?" she asked sarcastically.<br>
"This is home," I said with a luring voice.<br>
"I hope you'll live with us here."<br>
"Not so sure... I'll need to go home someday probably today."<br>
"I won't allow...," she said. 
<p>Meanwhile, I still had the milk and yam on my hand. I never wanted to consume it without her consent though I was already starting to feel some hunger. "Hey you, drink the milk," Wairimu said smiling. "But it's for you," I replied. "Well, I'll pour it out if don't want." "No don't, I'll take it." My mother had taught me not to waste food for some people are out there starving every single day. I wasn't going to not heed her teachings.

<p>Mutinda didn't take long as I thought he should. He walked in and ruined my already sweet conversation. Wairimu saw her and excused herself out. I knew she didn't like him. Him, however, liked her. It is the complex nature of love.</p>

<p>Dayo called us all to the kitchen where she was preparing some mrenda and ugali. We sat around the wooden kitchen table as we had some little talk. Mutinda sat between Dayo and I while Wairimu sat next to me on the left. She taught us old tales. A love tale since we were youths. The moral lesson that she gave was to always walk the line.</p>

<p>We ate as we had some fun. Life was really good. But one thing wasn't adding up yet; how and why was this old woman living in that bushy world with only her granddaughter? Did she have a family? Was she a goddess... or gods? Was she banished from her village? And how about the granddaughter? I couldn't find answers to those troubling questions. I was happy but scared. Time was gone and we had to sleep at her place. In the morning, we drank porridge and left off to the unknown. We had convinced the old lady that we were going home, which wasn't the case.</p>

<p>Wairimu bided us a goodbye with an unhappy face. She was sad that I was leaving. But I had to go. She escorted us out and gave me a hug. The fragrance of her home-made cologne was all over me. Gracious me. I’d hit the lottery.</p>
