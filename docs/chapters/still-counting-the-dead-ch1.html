      Dark clouds hovered over the countryside as a thin drizzle began to fall. Kyle watched from his window, the world below smeared into patches of blue and black, like bruises on the earth. The rain tapped gently against the glass, but the sound felt too deliberate, too aware of him.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
      He reached for the curtain and pulled it down—just as a sound rose behind him.

It was soft. Compassionate. Almost kind.
Yet it made his skin crawl.<br>

“Kyle…”
    </p>
     <p class="para">
     The voice didn’t come from any corner of the room. It didn’t echo. It simply existed—inside the air itself. Crying. Pleading.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
       His body locked. His teeth rattled. A cold weakness spread through his limbs like poison. He ran to his bed, buried himself under the duvet, eyes squeezed shut, breath tearing in and out of his chest.

But the blanket did nothing.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      More voices followed. Not loud. Not screaming. Just there. Whispering in overlapping tones, like a choir of broken throats.

He couldn’t take it.

Kyle threw the duvet aside and bolted for his mother’s room, stumbling over the laundry bucket, skinning his knee without feeling the pain.<br>

“Mom,” he called.<br>

Silence.

<p>The room was empty. The bed untouched. The air stale, like it had been abandoned hours ago.</p>

His mother had long known how isolated her son was. He barely went outside. He spoke little, smiled even less. A child psychologist once came, then another, and another. None of them stayed long. They all said the same thing in softer words: There is something wrong, but we don’t know what.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      She eventually convinced herself it was just how he was created. Strange. Quiet. Wrong in ways no one could name.

<p>Kyle walked back into the sitting room. From the study table, he picked up a blue pen and a sheet of paper. His hand moved without thought, scribbling lines he did not remember forming. Words. Names. Symbols that didn’t belong to any language he knew.</p>

When he finished, he turned the paper face down and aligned it perfectly with the edge of the table.<br>

The room smelled like fear.

He returned to his mother’s bedroom and called again. Louder this time. Still nothing.<br>

Then the voices came back.

Crying. Agonizing.<br>

“Do you read the Bible, Kyle?” one voice asked gently<br><br>

      I’m trapped… in these chains,” another whispered. “Trying to free myself of my undone deeds.”<br>

The voices weren’t arguing. They were confessing.

Kyle ran.

Back to his room. Back to the only place where the world made sense.<br>

Under his bed stood a red fortress—blankets draped like walls, lit faintly by the glow of hidden candles. He crawled inside. For a moment, blessedly, the voices faded.<br><br>

<p>Inside his safe zone stood three candles: red, white, and black. Their flames trembled though there was no wind. To the left was a grey picture frame, scratched and blurry, the image inside impossible to identify. A person. Maybe. Or what remained of one.</p>

Kyle knelt before it.<br>

He prayed.

      Not to God.<br>

To it.<br>

He spoke softly, carefully, like one does to something that might break if spoken to too loudly. He asked for comfort. For silence. For his soul to be loosened from whatever had tied it to this world.

“I see… I see de—” he whispered.<br>

The word died in his throat.

Because the picture blinked.<br>

Not the glass. Not the reflection.

The thing inside the frame moved.<br><br>

Kyle felt it then—the familiar pressure behind his eyes. The burning. The slow peeling sensation, like a veil being dragged away from his sight.

And suddenly, he saw.

Not the room.
      The truth beneath it.<br>

The walls were crowded.<br><br>

They stood shoulder to shoulder, pale figures layered over reality like stains that never washed out. Men with hollow chests. Women with mouths sewn shut by darkness. Children whose shadows moved even when they didn’t.<br><br>

All of them were looking at him.<br>
                            

All of them were dead.

Some were missing faces. Some were missing time. Some were only outlines, trembling like unfinished thoughts. Their eyes—if they still had eyes—were black wells of endless waiting.

They didn’t scream.

They waited.<br><br>

Kyle backed deeper into the red fortress, heart hammering, breath shaking.
      No one else sees you,” he whispered.<br>

A tall figure stepped forward from the crowd. Its body flickered, like an old film burning.<br><br>

“We know,” it said.<br><br>

The candles around Kyle flared violently.<br>

The voices returned—not around him, but through him.<br>

“You are the door,” they whispered.<br>
“And we are still counting...”
