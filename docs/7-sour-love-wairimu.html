  <section class="poem-content">

    <p>
      Wairimu,<br>
Like a typhoon,<br>
You've shaken my world,<br>
And built your own<br>
Wall of silence,<br>
Unbreakable by my pleas,<br>
But who will apologize first?<br><br>
    </p>

      <p>
Wairimu,<br>
Like the still waters,<br>
I never expected it to run so deep,<br>
Just a chat with Akinyi,<br>
And you exploded with anger,<br>
I enjoy her company,<br>
She's a colleague, she's a friend,<br>
Not so much with you,<br>
Should we not have other friends?<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
Wairimu,<br>
Like the tamarind,<br>
Your love tasted sour,<br>
And like garlic,<br>
Mine too, I guess, was bitter,<br>
Two tigers can't live on the same mountain,<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
      Let's move on,<br>
Let's separate everything,<br>
What do you say?<br>
I can't keep running circles in my mind.
    </p>
